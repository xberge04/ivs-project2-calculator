In file zprava.pdf we can see output of profiling with 10, 100, 1000 input values.

Program takes the most time invoking the system function for write to stdout and functions root and pow from math library.
Root() function is called only once but with big number which we get from smerodatnaOdchylka() function and function Pow() is called for each input value.
When optimizing our code, we should focus on algorithm in function smerodatnaOdchylka().
